For the defects4j benchmarks, we have copied the relevant java classes to each bug/java/original.
In bug/java/modified we have removed unused and or irrelevant code to the bug.
The reason for removing code is that OOX cannot support all operations yet (Strings, etc) and converting them is manual work.
