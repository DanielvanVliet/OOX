expression9:
 ( <expression> )  should be: expression 1, forall ignored otherwise



 fallthrough missing for ite en seq

 Something weird is going on with null, why add it to only then immediately remove it?


Original OOX deals with symbolic references in Z3 expressions as follows:
Find all concrete references (aliasMap) for each of the symbolic references 
create for each combination of these an expression with their concrete references
this results in multiple expressions that need to be solved


_node = [null, ref(1)] 
_next1 = [null, ref(1), ref(2)]


_node + _next1
becomes len(_node) * len(_next1) z3 invocations

null + null
null + ref(1)
null + ref(2)
ref(1) + null
ref(1) + ref(1)
ref(1) + ref(2)

Might it be better to keep _node and _next1 as variables in Z3? idk
as the number of symbolic references increases... this explodes!
